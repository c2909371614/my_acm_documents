Solution for task NET
-------- --- ---- ---
The network of schools can be represented by a directed graph whose vertices
are the schools and (A, B) is an edge in the graph iff school B is in the
distribution list of school A. Let us first reformulate the task using graph
terminology.
We use the notation p->q if there is a (directed) path from p to q in a graph.
A set of vertices D of a graph G is called dominator set of G if for each
vertex q there is a vertex p in D such that p->q.
Subtask A is to find a dominator set of G with minimal number of elements.
A set of vertices CD of G is called codominator set of G if for each vertex p
there is a vertex q in CD such that p->q. A graph G is called strongly
connected, if for all vertices p and q there is a path p->q and a path q->p
in G.
Solution of subtask B is the minimal number of new edges that are necessary
to make G strongly connected.
Let us denote the number of elements of a set S by |S|.
Let D be a minimal dominator set and CD be a minimal codominator set of G.

We shall prove that solution of subtask B is 0 if G is strongly connected,
and Max(|D|, |CD|) otherwise.
The proof follows from the statements S1 and S2.
We can assume without loss of generality that |D|<=|CD|.
S1. If D is a one element set containing p and CD contains the elements
    q1,...,qk then introducing the new edges (q1, p), ... , (qk, p) makes G
    strongly connected.
    Proof: Let u,v be arbitrary vertices of G. Then there is an element qi in
    CD such that u->qi, therefore u->qi->p->v is a path from u to v.
S2. If |D|>1 then there are vertices p in D and q in CD such that introducing
    the new edge (q, p) in G makes D-[p] a new dominator set and CD-[q] a new
    codominator set of G.
    Proof: Since |D|>1 there are different vertices p1 and p2 in D, and there
    are different vertices q1 and q2 in CD such that p1->q1 and p2->q2. Then
    the new edge (p,q) will be (q1,p2). Indeed, any vertex u that was
    reachable from p2 by the path p2->u will be reachable from p1 by
    p1->q1->p2->u and for any path v->q1 there will be a path v->q1->p2->q2
    in the new graph.

It is obvious that a codominator set of a graph G is a dominator set of the
transposed graph GT and conversely. Therefore we can compute the minimal
codominator set of G by transposing G and then computing the minimal dominator
set of the transposed graph.

The strategy for computing a minimal dominator set is the following.
( We use Pascal terminology for set operations )

  Dominated:=[];
  D:=[];
  While there is a p not in Dominated Do Begin
    Search(p);(* put all vertices in set Reachable that are reachable from p*)
    Dominated:=Dominated+Reachable;
    D:=D-Reachable; (* exclude all elements of D that are in Reachable *)
    Include p in D;
  End;

Evidently the set D that is produced by this algorithm is a dominator set.
Assume that D contains the vertices p1,...,pk and D is not minimal, i.e.
there is a minimal dominator set Q that contains vertices q1,...ql, and l<k.
Since D is a dominator set and Q is a minimal dominator set it follows that
for each qi in Q there is a unique pi in D such that qi is reachable from pi
by a path pi->qi. But every vertex is reachable from Q, therefore pk is also
reachable from some vertex in Q, say qi->pk. We obtained that there is a path
pi->qi->pk from pi to pk. The algorithm has executed both Search(pi) and
Search(pk). Either Search(pi) or Search(pk) was executed first, the vertex
pk was excluded from D because pk is reachable from pi. This contradicts to
the assumption that D is not minimal.

The algorithm above can be modified to avoid set operations union (+) and
difference (-). Indeed, when Search(p) is executed, we can include p in the
set Dominated and exclude p from D.
